# PHPShield

**Simple Lightweight PHP Application DoS/Rate Limiting Protection**

PHPShield is a pure PHP application-level protection system designed to help defend against small-scale DoS (Denial of Service) attacks and abusive traffic.  
It uses session-based rate limiting and basic IP blocking â€” no external firewall, proxy, or complex server configuration needed!
